                <li> 1. SHCS: UC Davis Student Health and Counseling Services is one of the health care components of the University of California</li>

                <li> 2. MEDICAL CONSENT: I consent to any medical treatments or procedures, X-ray examinations, drawing blood for tests, medications, injections, telehealth services, taking of medical photographs, videotaping, and/or laboratory procedures rendered to me under the general and special instructions of the physicians or other medical providers of SHCS assisting in my care.</li>   
                
                <li>3. TEACHING, RESEARCH AND HEALTHCARE INSTITUTION: The University of California is a teaching, research and healthcare institution. I understand that medical residents, medical students, students of ancillary health care professions (e.g., nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy), post-graduate fellows, and other trainees may observe, examine, treat or otherwise participate in my care at the request and under the supervision of my health care provider as part of the University's medical education programs. Any use of my medical information and/or specimens by SHCS or other institutions will be in accordance with state and federal law, including all laws and regulations governing confidentiality of patient records.</li>
                
                <li> 4. RELEASE OF INFORMATION: SHCS will obtain my written authorization to release information about my medical treatment, except in those circumstances when SHCS is permitted or required by law to release information (see SHCS' Notice of Privacy Practices for a description of the specific circumstances under which SHCS may release this information). For example, SHCS may release a copy of my patient record to other health care providers, health plans and government agencies for continuity of care and/or billing issues. Additionally, I understand that if I am diagnosed with a communicable disease such as tuberculosis or a sexually transmitted disease, reportable in California, SHCS is required by law to report my diagnosis to the local health authority.</li>
                
                <li>5. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION: The California Information Practices Act requires SHCS to provide the following information to individuals who supply information about themselves: As a patient of SHCS, you will be asked to submit information about yourself, such as your address and phone number, Social Security number, insurance information, medical history and treatment, and other personal information. The principal purpose for requesting this information is to ensure accurate identification, continuity of medical care, and payment for such care.</li>
                
                <li>6. PERSONAL VALUABLES: I understand and agree that SHCS shall not be liable for loss or damage to any personal property I may bring with me to SHCS, including backpacks and purses, glasses, jewelry, clothing, or items of unusual value.</li>
                
                <li> 7. RECORDINGS: I agree that while at SHCS, I shall not videotape, audiotape or otherwise record any portion of my visit or interactions, unless expressly authorized by the SHCS Executive Director, SHCS Medical Director or designee.</li>
                
                <li>8. FINANCIAL AGREEMENT: I agree to pay The Regents of the University of California for professional and clinic services not otherwise paid or covered by insurance or other sources, in accordance with the established fees in effect on the date of service. Fees incurred at SHCS are billed to UC Davis Student Accounts unless other methods of payment are mutually agreed upon prior to services rendered.</li>
